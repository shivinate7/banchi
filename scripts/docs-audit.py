"""Docs staleness audit — the mechanical half. See docs/DECISIONS.md D16.

Ten markdown files carry this project's architecture and its rationale. Nothing verified
them until this script existed, so every path, target, subcommand, test id and decision
number in them was true only for as long as someone remembered.

THE AUDIT NEVER WRITES. It opens, compares, prints, and sets an exit code. The only writes
in this file are inside `--self-test`, into a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` it creates
and destroys; nothing on the audit path can touch a tracked file. Adding a `--fix` flag is
a design change, not a knob — a tool that can edit the docs to make its own check pass is
a tool that converts the project's memory into fiction. Same reason it parses with `ast`
instead of importing: importing a project module runs its top-level code, and "read-only"
should mean read-only.

Two severities, split by how knowable each finding is:

  MECHANICAL (exit 1)  a reference is provably wrong. A path that does not resolve, a
                       `make` target that does not exist, a threshold that disagrees with
                       docs/GATES.md. No judgment involved, so it blocks.
  ADVISORY   (exit 2)  a question. Code changed and the doc that describes it did not.
                       Prints and allows: blocking on a question trains you to reach for
                       `git commit --no-verify`, which also disables the opsec guard.

Stdlib only, so the git hook can call `python3` directly and never depends on `make venv`
having been run.

    scripts/docs-audit.py              audit the whole tree
    scripts/docs-audit.py --staged     audit the staged set (what the pre-commit hook runs)
    scripts/docs-audit.py --self-test  prove the extractors work before trusting a report

Escape hatch: PKMNSCAN_DOCS=off, honored by the hook, mirroring PKMNSCAN_GATE=off in
scripts/stop-gate.sh. Deliberate, visible in your shell, and unlike editing this file it
does not change what the check means.
